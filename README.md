I have fixed the AliveGR liveTV url by pointing it to a m3u source that is up to date. You will still need the dependencies from the AliveGR repository.

The VOD of this addon pulls the show listing from the greek-movies.com website. These are still working for me.

12/24/2025 - The parser was no longer working thus the series weren't showing. I have fixed the parser.

Please use release AliveGR 2.12.2 to the right.
