I have fixed the AliveGR liveTV url by pointing it to a m3u source that is up to date. You will still need the dependencies from the AliveGR repository.

The VOD of this addon pulls the show listing from the greek-movies.com website. These are still working for me.

12/24/2025 - The parser was no longer working thus the series weren't showing. I have fixed the parser.
12/26/2025 - Combine two m3u's from github to give more LiveTV choices.
1/7/2026 - Fixed parser that would throw an error when a year wasn't found thus you couldn't watch the series.

Please use release AliveGR 2.12.4 to the right.
